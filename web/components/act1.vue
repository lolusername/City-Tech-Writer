    INT. HOME - DAY



CHRIS, 20, just came back from his college classes and lays down on his couch. 



CHRIS
I’m so tired, hold up, let me play some music so it can keep me up.



Chris takes out his phone from his pocket



CHRIS
YOOOOO that new KHALED KHALED just dropped. Hold up, I gotta play this.



Chris reaches for his pocket to get his airpods but they’re not there.
CHRIS
Wait, what?



Chris begins to panic and starts to look through his bookbag and then he checks below the couch. He looks around the living room and then his whole house. He then gives up and goes to his room.



CHRIS
I gotta listen to this new KHALED KHALED, son.
I have an idea.



Chris turns on his PC and goes on Ebay and types in the words “airpods.” The price of the airpods is shown.



CHRIS
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS?



Chris sighs.



CHRIS 
Anything for that KHALED KHALED.
