   INT. HOME - TWO WEEKS LATER



Chris receives a notification on his phone saying that his package was delivered.



CHRIS
IT’S FINALLY HERE!



Chris runs to his door and gets his package. He then runs back to his room. Very anxious and excited to open his new airpods, Chris rips open the packaging and opens the box.




CHRIS
LET’S GET IT, TIME TO LISTEN TO THAT KHALED KHA-



Chris reaches into the box and takes out wired headphones.



CHRIS
THE HELL IS THIS?



Devastated and tired, Chris accepts that he ordered the wrong headphones.



CHRIS
Well, I’m going to have to listen to that new Khaled Khaled with these things.



Chris sits down on the sofa. He realizes something is bothering him in his back pocket. He reaches for it and sees that his airpods have been there.



CHRIS
Yoo these are my airpods! Well, I got what I need! Now to listen to that Khaled Khaled.



Chris lies down on his bed and gets ready to listen to some music. Chris sighs.



CHRIS
Ahh, finally …



He opens the airpod case and sees that not one headphone is inside. Chris then looks directly up to his ceiling.



CHRIS
AAAHHHHH-



CUT TO BLACK.
