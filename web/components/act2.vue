      INT. HOME - MONTAGE



In a series of clips, Chris is seen walking around the house miserably while only eating Lifesaver gummies.



CHRIS
And there I was, waiting for my brand new airpods that I spent twelve hundred forty-five dollars on. As the days went by, I’ve noticed that my addiction to lifesavers has grown tremendously, I mean, it's the only thing that I eat now. Plus, all my money's gone thanks to the airpods (anything for that KHALED KHALED). For that price, I should be getting the next iphone for free. My patience is getting slimmer by the day, all my friends are listening to that Khaled heat, while I’m over here eating these damn Lifesavers. 



Chris opens his refrigerator.



CHRIS
I need to eat something. I don’t want to pay twenty dollars on delivery fees for Uber Eats, just for a McChicken and six-piece chicken nuggets. These Lifesavers will have to do.



Chris walks towards his living room.



CHRIS
All this waiting for the headphones has made me go insane. I mean look at me, I look like a psychotic hobo getting addicted to some damn — 



Chris stops walking and looks at his bag of Lifesavers.



CHRIS
Wait, I don’t even like Lifesavers.



Chris throws the bag of candy out of frame.
